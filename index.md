### Introduction of Kevin as a student
Hi, my name is **Kevin Yu** and I was a transfer student of 2020. This is my first quarter being in UCSD campus and I am suprised by the size of it. Before that, My mother was a little worried before I moved to San Diego to become independent from the family. I remember she always says:
> "Son, remember to get enough sleep, eat three meals each day, and wear more clothes to prevent getting cold! Also, don't forget to come back to LA every weekend!" 

### Introduction of Kevin as a person
